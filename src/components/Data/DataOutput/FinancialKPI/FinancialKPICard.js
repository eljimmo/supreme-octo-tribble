      Operating Expense Ratio (OER)
      Gross Margin: Gross margin is a financial metric that represents the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS).
            Where:

Operating Expenses include all expenses related to the core operations of the business, such as salaries, rent, utilities, and other day-to-day costs.
Total Revenue is the total income generated from sales of goods or services.

Key Points:

A lower OER suggests that a company is more efficient in managing its operating expenses relative to its revenue.
A higher OER indicates that a larger portion of revenue is used to cover operating costs, which might suggest inefficiencies or higher operational costs.

      Revenue Growth Rate (RGR): The Revenue Growth Rate is a financial metric that measures the percentage increase or decrease in a companyâ€™s revenue over a specific period. 
            It helps to assess how quickly a companys revenue is growing and can be a key indicator of business performance and market potential.

      Current Period Revenue (CPR): is the revenue earned during the current reporting period (e.g., the current fiscal quarter or year).
    Previous Period Revenue is the revenue earned during the previous comparable period.

Key Points:

    A positive Revenue Growth Rate indicates an increase in revenue, reflecting successful business expansion or increased sales.
    A negative Revenue Growth Rate indicates a decrease in revenue, which may signal declining sales or business challenges.
